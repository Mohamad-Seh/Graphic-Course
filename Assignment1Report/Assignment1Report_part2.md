## 2+3.Scaling , translation and drawing
we did this step by applying an initial scaling value that equals 50 using the local scaling matrix att the MeshModel constructor

![enter image description here](Assb_2Scale.png)

then we translated all the x cordinates for all the vertices by 640 and the y vertices by 320 to translate the model into the middle of the window we did this step at the renderer class at the DrawMesh function that we added.
DrawMeshFunction:

for the drowing we added a new method DrawMesh that takes a mesh model with gis vertices list and faces and then iterated over all the faces and used DrawLine function from the last assignement to draw the lines between the face cordinates.
and we got this result:

## 4.GUI items for local and world frame selection and transformations
the transformation computed by multiplying 10  matrices(4x4) 5 for each frame(local and world)
for each frame there are scaling matrix, translation matrix  and 3 rotation matrices for each axis(x,y,z) the multiplying order is (Tw*Sw*RXw*RYw*RZw*Tl*RXl*RYl*RZl*Sl)
to make a change in a specific matrix  we choose the wanted matrix from the dropdown list then a three sliders appears and shows the currenet values of the matrix and by moving the slider we changing the value and all the matrices are multiplied again, and at the DrawMeshFunction at the renderer class we take every vertix and make it a homogeneous coordinate then multiplying the matrix with the coordinate and transfer it back to a regular coordinate then drawing it.

## 5.Comparing transformations in different orders

 - translating in the model frame and then rotating in the world frame:

 - translating in the world frame then rotating in the local frame:

## 6.Multiple MeshModels

## 7.Transformations Using keyboard
we use the w,a,s,d for translation 
a-translate left
d-translate right
w-translate up
s- translate down
at the main class at the RenderFrame function we added four if statements to check if one of the keys is down if yes we check if there is an active model then we get it and check in which frame we are then make a translation by 10 units according to the down key and the frame.
